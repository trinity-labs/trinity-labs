# Pocket Mainframe
*(aka Home Mainframe)*
<br>
<br>
**Begin of the story** - Re-use a screen broken laptop motherboard to get an home server, home theater and small Nas. Board from:

**TOSHIBA P875-101**
- 4 DDR3 Up to 32Go
- Intel Core i7 3610QM - 4 Cores | 8 Threads - TDP 45W - *No fanless yet but semi-passive*
- NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M
- 3 SATA III (convert optical drive)
- 1 HDMI
- 1 LAN
- 1 LVDS
- 2 USB3
- Battery Removed - Low powered @ 90W power supply

**Then want to find and test in a well know Thin Mini-ITX standard**

Since‚ö°cost more and more - It's important to power saving all my electrical material, and preserve the planet at my scale üå≥ So PCs and Server are warmly involved... 

*(2x 500W = 1000W power supply previous 2020 config)*

So at this point, I'm convinced that I now need material that I can easily **re-use/repair/upgrade** - 3 essential points. **A virtuous cycle!**

üü™ **TRINITY Project** was born<br> 

So to test it in prod env, I need a basic material, according to my old one (LGA 1150) and my new philosophy. So I'm gone to search an industrial grade thin mini-ITX
Find this one refurbished:

**AAEON EMB-H81B**
- 2 DDR3 Up to 16Go
- Intel Core i3 4160T - 2 Cores | 4 Threads - TDP 45W - Fanless
- Integrated Graphics up to 1Go
- 3 SATA III (convert optical drive)
- 1 HDMI
- 1 LAN
- 1 LVDS
- 2 USB3
- 1 PCIe X1
- Standard PC I/O
- Low powered @ 120W power supply

**See on | [FanlessTech](https://www.fanlesstech.com/2023/05/750g-copper-cooler.html)**

**This is an important achieve goal here.** Set test & stress on this x86 fanless board:

- Definitly choose Alpine Linux to fit on (and all others)
- Definitly choose LGA sockets (Intel or AMD)
- Definitly choose So-dimm RAM sockets
- Definitly choose sata or nvme emplacement (1 minimum)

Want to remove my sh***ty internet provider router too - so we install an 1x PCIe 4 ports Ethernet card

Other extensions like PCIe or LVDS can be add for special applications

**Bang and Olufsen and me ...**
Long story since I discover their products at 6 years at my parents' house and few others along years. I'm fascinated! Today

**Influenced by B&O** design and reliability, I want to built beatiful object than can be easy fixed and upgrade to preserve it's shell, like an **unique object.**

- Use oak or ebony (ideally reused oak)
- Use lot of copper 
- Bit of aluminum

Final goal is to be able to built AIO PC or Server in **noble materials** and small **limited hand-made production** in Versailles - France.
